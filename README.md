# UniversityAdmissionPython
(October 2020 - December 2020)

Pure Python Project Replicating the Admission Procedure of a Make-Belief University. This Project includes File management along with Python Concepts. Enables operations such as New Admission, Fee Payment,  Registration Payment etc.

This Project creates a file called "University" where the information regarding every student studying in the university is stored in the Dictionary data type.

There are 3 sections to this Interface. 
1. We can view details of the student on the basis of their Student ID issued by the college.
2. We can admit a new student (on the basis of availability), modify the details of students or remove students (AKA, Graduation)
3. We can pay the Registration fee. Only after paying the registration fee, we will be able to pay the academic fee.
